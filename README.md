# Discord active developer badge bot
Simple discord bot written in AArch64 assembly to redeem the active developer badge.

# Setup
Requirements:
```
A working GNU C compiler (because i wrote it in the GAS dialect);
Open SSL;
LibCURL;
GNU Make;
Concord (dev branch)
```
To build the bot simply type make and press Enter.

With this, create an environment variable called TOKEN; set its value to your token and then run the executable file

A tutorial to setup concord can be found [here](https://github.com/Cogmasters/concord/blob/dev/README.md).
